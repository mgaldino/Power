This repository contains the research paper on defining and measuring presidential power relative to legislative power in Brazilian democracies. Currently, we are in the process of gathering data and compiling relevant literature for a comprehensive review. The current list of papers to be reviewed is available in our [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5576605/paper_power/library).

Brazilian federal data (2008-2023) are sourced from: [Tesouro Transparente](https://www.tesourotransparente.gov.br/ckan/dataset/despesas-e-transferencias-totais)
